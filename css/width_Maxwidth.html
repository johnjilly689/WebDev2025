<!-- Note*** in CSS, width generally refers to the content's width, excluding padding, borders, and margins. The max-width and min-width properties also apply to the content's width only, setting the upper and lower limits respectively.

However, if the box-sizing property is set to border-box, then width, max-width, and min-width will include padding and borders in their calculations. -->
<!-- Just note that margin: auto; works best when the element has a defined width. Otherwise, the browser won’t know how much space to distribute. -->

<style>
  .container {
    border: red solid 3px;
    width: 100px;
    /* try Removing width , you will understand that .container and Paragraph have own width */
    margin: auto;
  }
  .container > p {
    border: green 2px solid;
    width: 50px;
    margin: auto;
    /* height: 10px; */
  }

  .maxcontainer {
    border: blue solid 3px;
    max-width: 1000px;
    /* try Removing width , you will understand that .container and Paragraph have own width */
    margin: auto;
  }

  .maxcontainer > p {
    border: green 2px solid;
    max-width: 500px;
    margin: auto;
  }
</style>
<!-- a block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).
Setting the width of a block-level element will prevent it from stretching out to the edges of its container. Then, you can set the margins to auto, to horizontally center the element within its container. The element will take up the specified width, and the remaining space will be split equally between the two margins: -->
<div class="container">
  <p>Hello World</p>
</div>

<div class="maxcontainer">
  <p>hello maxcontainer</p>
</div>
<!-- 
Yes, margin: auto; primarily works horizontally for block-level elements when a width is set—it automatically distributes equal left and right margins, centering the element.
However, vertically, margin: auto; only works if the element's parent has a set height AND uses special layout techniques like flexbox or grid. -->
<!-- If height is defined, margin: auto; can work both horizontally and vertically—but only under certain conditions.
By default:
Horizontally: Works when the element has a defined width.
Vertically: Does not automatically center unless the parent has a defined height and is using special layouts like flexbox, grid, or absolute positioning. -->
