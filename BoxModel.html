      <strong>Note:</strong>Important: When you set the width and height
      properties of an element with CSS, you just set the width and height of
      the content area. To calculate the total width and height of an element,
      you must also include the padding and borders.
    </p>
    <div class="boxmodeldiagram">
      <p>
        Explanation of the different parts: Content - The content of the box,
        where text and images appear Padding - Clears an area around the
        content. The padding is transparent Border - A border that goes around
        the padding and content Margin - Clears an area outside the border. The
        margin is transparent
      </p>

      que. but when we talk of width and height it is of content height and
      width right? then according to your saying will content width be 240px?
      <br />
      ans: That's a great observation! Let's clarify how the width behaves in
      relation to content, padding, and the total element size. Understanding
      Content Width vs. Total Width - By default (box-sizing: content-box), the
      width and height refer only to the content area. - Padding is extra and
      adds to the total size of the element. If you set: width: 200px; padding:
      20px; - The content width remains 200px. - But the total width (including
      padding) will be 240px (200px content + 20px left padding + 20px right
      padding).
    </p>

    <p>
      The margin property also affects the total space that the box will take up
      on the page, but the margin is not included in the actual size of the box.
      The box's total width and height stops at the border.

      q. example the h1 element has a bottom margin of 50px and the h2 element
      has a top margin of 20px. So, the vertical margin between h1 and h2 should
      have been 70px (50px + 20px). However, due to margin collapse, the actual
      margin ends up being 50px. then what will be total height of h2 now will i
      take margin as 20 or 50?
      <br />
      ans: Great question! Because of margin collapse, the larger margin (50px
      from h1) takes precedence, and the smaller one (20px from h2) is ignored.
      How to Calculate Total Height of - The content height of stays the same. -
      Padding and border of are unaffected by margin collapse. - Margin behaves
      differently:- The collapsed margin affects the space between elements, but
      it does not add to h2's height directly. So, if you are calculating the
      total height of h2, you only consider its own margin, padding, and
      borderâ€”not the collapsed margin. Final Answer: - When measuring element
      height (including padding/border): Take its own margin (20px). - When
      measuring the spacing between elements: The vertical gap is 50px, because
      of margin collapse.

    <strong>Margin collapse</strong>
    <h1>hello i am h1 with 50px margin</h1>
    <h2>
      hello i am h2 with 20px margin, but because of margin collapse i take 50
      margin from top and bottom, but you will see 20 margin on browser layout
      but actuall i have 50 dont get confused
    </h2>
